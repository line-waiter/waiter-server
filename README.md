# LineWaiter
This is a mobile-first designed app to tackle the problem of people wasting their life waiting in line. You can either pay someone to wait in line for you, or get paid to do so. LineWaiter allows people to make a request for a certain location at a certain time. Waiters can accept that request and earn money for waiting.
